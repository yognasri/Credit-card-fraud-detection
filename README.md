Credit card fraud is increasing day by day. Credit card fraud can be done in both online and offline transactions.  In offline transactions Physical cards are required while in online transactions the virtual cards are required for doing illegal or fraud activities. Thus, these fraud activities in credit card may lead to many fraud transactions without the knowledge of the actual users. The fraudsters are looking for sensitive information such as credit card number, bank account and other user details in order to perform transactions.
		There are many fraud transactions which cannot be easily identified by the user and also by the banking authority which leads to loss of sensitive data. There are various models which are used for detecting the fraud transactions based on the behavior of the transactions and these methods can be classified as two broad categories such as supervised learning and unsupervised learning algorithm. In existing system for finding the accuracy of the fraudulent activates they have used methods such as Cluster Analysis, Support Vector Machine, Na√Øve Bayer's Classification etc. The aim of this Project is to detect the accuracy of the fraudulent transactions by using Random Forest Algorithm.
